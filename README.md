# Breach Engine

Breach Engine is a lightweight, Scratch-based 2D game engine focused on **dynamic physics, collision handling, and performance optimization**.  
It has been developed over three years with the goal of pushing Scratch to its limits while staying approachable for creators.

## Features
- Custom **physics and collision system** with iterative corrections  
- Support for **dynamic objects** and **map-based priority physics**  
- Watchdog/debug system to catch rare edge-case errors  
- Compact codebase (~1200 blocks/lines) for easier understanding and modification  
- Designed for **tech demos, experiments, and game projects**
